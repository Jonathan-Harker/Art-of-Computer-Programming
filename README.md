# Art-of-Computer-Programming
As I enjoy getting lost in the world of algorithms I have made a project out of working through the excellent work "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth.

Here are my attempts some exercise solutions in form of documentation and code.

Some algorithms that I have implemented so far are 
* [Euclids Algorithm 1.1](/exercises/chapter_1/one/euclids_algorithm.py) - the highest common divisor of 2 numbers
* [Log Calculator 1.2.2](/exercises/chapter_1/two/log_calculator.py) - An approximation that uses log table constants
* [Return numbers with only ones in any base recursively 1.2.3](/exercises/chapter_1/two/only_ones.py)
* [Calculate Modulus 1.2.4](/exercises/chapter_1/two/calculate_modulus.py)
* [Get the bionomial coefficient 1.2.6](/exercises/chapter_1/two/binomial_coefficients.py)
* [Get h - the harmonic number 1.2.7](exercises/chapter_1/two/harmonic_numbers.py)
* [A game you can't win - play on the command line if you do not believe me!](applications/counters_game.py) - Based on a practical application of Fibonacci numbers
* [Topological Sort](exercises/chapter_2/linked_allocation/topological_sort.py)

## MIX Design & Build
What would MIX look like if we attempted to build it?

<details>
  <summary>How it works</summary>
The oscillator increases its count by 1.

The address is then fetched from the internal memory.

The content of the memory is then put on the opcode register.

The opcode decoder then translates the opcode into the action that needs to be taken. For example:

* A calculation by the ALU
  * The output will typically be written to a register or memory row
* A copy of contents from register to memory
* A copy of contents of register to register
* A copy of contents of memory to register
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Overview</summary>
  At a high level we would need

  * An oscillator 
  * 4000 rows of Memory address
  * Register A
  * Regsiter X
  * I Registers 1 - 5
  * J Register
  * Overflow Indicator
  * GLE Indicator
  * OpCode Register
  * OpCode Decoder
  * ALU Chip
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Memory</summary>
There are 4000 rows of memory.  
Each row of memory contains a +/- sign followed by 5 memory cells.  

Each memory cell can contain 64 values so 6 bits of information.  
We require 1 bit for the +/- sign and 6 bits * 5 cells for the row.

Each row therefore requires 31 bits. As a power of 2 we require 32 bits of memory per address row.  

Total memory capacity of MIX = 32 * 4000 = 128000 bits = 16kb of memory

Memory row:

At minimum each row will need to be divided across 4 8 bit SRAM chips.  

For simplicity, we could use 5 SRAM chips using only 6 bits, so we have 1 for each cell.

## 1.1 Euclids Algorithm
<details>
  <summary>Exercise 1: Rearrange Items</summary>
  
  **Rearrange a, b, c, d to b, c, d, a**  
  e <-- b (a, b, c, d, b)  
  b <-- c (a, c, c, d, b)  
  c <-- d (a, c, d, d, b)  
  d <-- a (a, c, d, a, b)
  a <-- e (b, c, d, a)
</details>  

<details>
  <summary>Exercise 2: Prove m is always greater than n</summary>
  
**Prove m is always greater than n (except first iteration)**    

**Euclids Algorithm**  
E0: If m < n, exchange m <--> n  
E1: Divide m by n and let r be the remainder  
E2:  if r = 0 return n  
E3: Set m <- n, n <- r 

**Constraints**  
* n cannot be 1 as there would be no remainder  
* m and n cannot be equal as there would be no remainder  

**Attempted Solution**  
* r = m % n  
* We set m < n and n < r  
* This equals m < n and n < m % n 
* Whatever the value of n, m must be greater than m % n  
* m > m % n
</details>

<details>
<summary>Exercise 3: Avoid trivial replacements</summary>

  **Avoid Trivial Replacements**  

  **Attempted Solution**  
  Algorithm F - this looks like recursion
  * If m % n = 0 return n (Iteration 1)
  * If n % (m % n) = 0 return m % n (Iteration 2)
  * If (m % n) % (n % (m % n)) = 0 return n % (m % n) (Iteration 3)
  * If (n % (m % n)) % ((m % n) % (n % (m % n))) = 0 return (m % n) % (n % (m % n)) (Iteration 4)  

  The whole expression becomes the second arg  
  The second part of the expression, after the first modulus sign, becomes the first arg  

  So I seem to have overcomplicated this one...
  I have created a [recursive solution]("/exercises/chapter_1/one/euclids_algorithm") based on this

Average = 48 / 20 = 2.4
Check solution using the [recursive function]("/exercises/chapter_1/one/exercise_six").  
Setting m to 1,000,000 can be run in a reasonable time with the answer of 2.599996.  
This is very close to 2.6

## 1.2.1 Proof by Induction
<details>
<summary>Prove that the Fibonacci numbers satisfy F(n) >= œï<sup>n-2</sup></summary>

Where:

* œï = (1 + ‚àö5) / 2  
* 1 + œï = œï<sup>2</sup>   

Test:
* F<sub>(1)</sub> = 1
* F<sub>(1)</sub> >= œï<sup>n-2</sup> = œï<sup>-1</sup>
* 1 >= œï<sup>-1</sup>
* 1 >= 1 / œï
* œï >= 1 (Multiply by œï)
* (1 + ‚àö5) / 2 >= 1 (Sub real value for œï)
* 1 + ‚àö5 >= 2
* ‚àö5 >= 1 (Test is True)

Assert:
* F<sub>(n)</sub> >= œï<sup>n-2</sup>
* So F<sub>(n+1)</sub> >= œï<sup>n-1</sup>
* And F<sub>(n-1)</sub> >= œï<sup>n-3</sup>

Prove:
* F<sub>(n+1)</sub> >= F<sub>(n-1)</sub> + F<sub>(n)</sub> (The next in the sequence adds the previous 2 numbers)
* F<sub>(n+1)</sub> >= œï<sup>n-3</sup> + œï<sup>n-2</sup> (Substitute for the phi)
* œï<sup>n-3</sup> + œï<sup>n-2</sup> = œï<sup>n-3</sup>(1 + œï)
* œï<sup>n-3</sup>(1 + œï) = œï<sup>n-3</sup>(œï<sup>2</sup>) (As 1 + œï = œï<sup>2</sup>)
* œï<sup>n-3</sup>(œï<sup>2</sup>) = œï<sup>n-1</sup>
* œï<sup>n-3</sup> + œï<sup>n-2</sup> = œï<sup>n-1</sup>
* F<sub>(n+1)</sub> >= œï<sup>n-1</sup>
* F<sub>(n)</sub> >= œï<sup>n-2</sup> - **Proof is Correct**

<summary>Will a 14 digit integer fit in a computer word with a capacity of 47 bits?</summary>

Let us assume that the 14 digit integer is going be at its max value.  
This would make the integer have a value of 99,999,999,999,999 or 9.9 * 10<sup>13</sup>  
Lets call this integer *i*   
Mathematically this question is asking is 47 >= log<sub>2</sub>(i)?  
We could ask what is the max value that a 47 bit integer will hold?  
This is simple to answer as it is 2<sup>47</sup> which is 1.4 * 10<sup>14</sup>  
The max allowed value of 1.4 * 10<sup>14</sup> is much greater than 9.9 * 10<sup>13</sup>  
Therefore **Yes the 14 digit integer will fit into a 47 bit value**

## 1.2.3 Sums and Product
<details>
<summary>What is the equivalent of each side of <sub>i=1</sub><sup>3</sup>ùö∫ <sub>j=1</sub><sup>i</sup>ùö∫a<sub>ij</sub> = <sub>j=1</sub><sup>3</sup>ùö∫ <sub>i=j</sub><sup>3</sup>ùö∫a<sub>ij</sub></summary>

We are dealing with a loop within a loop. However, the inner loop is either reduced or incremented by an iteration each time the outer loop iterates.  

**LHS** - <sub>i=1</sub><sup>3</sup>ùö∫ <sub>j=1</sub><sup>i</sup>ùö∫a<sub>ij</sub>
* i=1 j=1 11 (next j gets reset, i gets incremented)
* i=2 j=1 21
* i=2 j=2 22 (next j gets reset, i gets incremented)
* i=3 j=1 31
* i=3 j=2 32
* i=3 j=3 33 (now both loops end)  

**LHS** = a<sub>11</sub> + (a<sub>21</sub> + a<sub>22</sub>) + (a<sub>31</sub> + a<sub>32</sub> + a<sub>33</sub>)

**RHS** - <sub>j=1</sub><sup>3</sup>ùö∫ <sub>i=j</sub><sup>3</sup>ùö∫a<sub>ij</sub>
* i=1 j=1 11
* i=2 j=1 21
* i=3 j=1 31 (j gets incremented, i gets reset to j)
* i=2 j=2 22
* i=3 j=2 32 (j gets incremented, i gets reset to j)
* i=3 j-3 33 (now both loops end)  

**RHS** = (a<sub>11</sub> + a<sub>21</sub> + a<sub>31</sub>) + (a<sub>22</sub> + a<sub>32</sub>) + a<sub>33</sub>  

**RHS == LHS**

<summary>Write the sequence 9*1+3=11, 9*12+3=111, 9*123+4=1111, 9*1234+5=11111 in sigma notation</summary>

If we were solving this in programming then we could use string parsing. However, a mathematical solution is more elegant.  

I have taken the authors solutions here and applied them to the case of n=4.

General formulae for base 10 is 9 <sub>k=0</sub><sup>n</sup>ùö∫(n-k)10<sup>k</sup> + (n+1)  
Note that the multiplication by 9 and the addition of 5 is done on the result of the sum.  

Where n=4:  
9 <sub>k=0</sub><sup>4</sup>ùö∫(4-k)10<sup>k</sup> + 5  

Summation loop as follows:
* k<sub>0</sub> = (4-0)10<sup>0</sup> = 4*1 = 4
* k<sub>1</sub> = (4-1)10<sup>1</sup> = 3*10 = 30
* k<sub>2</sub> = (4-2)10<sup>2</sup> = 2*100 = 200
* k<sub>3</sub> = (4-3)10<sup>3</sup> = 1*1000 = 1000
* k<sub>4</sub> = (4-4)10<sup>3</sup> = 0*10000 = 0

Sum total: 1000 + 200 + 30 + 4 = 1234  
Multiply by 9: 1234 * 9 = 11106  
Add 5: 11106 + 5 = 11111

It works for base 2 also!
General formulae for any base is...  
(b-1)<sub>k=0</sub><sup>n</sup>ùö∫(n-k)b<sup>k</sup> + (n+1)  
So for base 2 we get  
(1)<sub>k=0</sub><sup>n</sup>ùö∫(n-k)2<sup>k</sup> + (n+1)  
The multiplier is not needed in this case  
<sub>k=0</sub><sup>n</sup>ùö∫(n-k)2<sup>k</sup> + (n+1)

Take n = 4 in base 2  
<sub>k=0</sub><sup>n</sup>ùö∫(2-k)2<sup>2</sup> + 5  
* k<sub>0</sub> = (4-0)2<sup>0</sup> = 4*1 = 4
* k<sub>1</sub> = (4-1)2<sup>1</sup> = 3*2 = 6
* k<sub>2</sub> = (4-2)2<sup>2</sup> = 2*4 = 8
* k<sub>3</sub> = (4-3)2<sup>3</sup> = 1*8 = 8
* k<sub>4</sub> = (4-4)2<sup>3</sup> = 0*16 = 0

Sum total: 4 + 6 + 8 + 8 = 26  
Multiplier is 1 so nothing to do here    
Add 5: 26 + 5 = 31  which is 32 - 1   
This gives us 100000 - 1 = 11111 in binary

However, this notation can be simplified  
(b-1)<sub>k=0</sub><sup>n</sup>ùö∫(n-k)b<sup>k</sup> + (n+1) = <sub>k=0</sub><sup>n</sup>ùö∫ b<sup>k</sup>  
Does the new notation work?  
Let us try n=4 in base 2.  
<sub>k=0</sub><sup>n</sup>ùö∫ b<sup>k</sup> = 2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31  
Base 10 is also simple = 1 + 10 + 100 + 1000 + 10000 = 11111

So with this simpler notation we get the same result in both base 2 and base 10

## 1.2.5 Factorials
<details>
<summary>Express 20! as a product of its prime factors</summary>

20! = <sub>k>0</sub>ùö∫ floor(20 / p<sup>k</sup>) for each prime factor  
Primes up to 20 = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19  
As the 11, 13, 17 and 19 result in 1 by this sequence then we don't need to do any futher calculations for these numbers.  
We simply need to multiply the result by 11 * 13 * 17 * 19
* 20! as 2: <sub>k>0</sub>ùö∫ floor(20 / 2<sup>k</sup>)
  * floor(20/2<sup>1</sup>) + floor(20/2<sup>2</sup>) + floor(20/2<sup>3</sup>) + floor(20/2<sup>4</sup>)
  * 10 + 5 + 2 + 1
  * 2<sup>18</sup>
* 20! as 3: <sub>k>0</sub>ùö∫ floor(20 / 3<sup>k</sup>)
  * floor(20/3<sup>1</sup>) + floor(20/3<sup>2</sup>)
  * 6 + 2
  * 3<sup>8</sup>
* 20! as 5: <sub>k>0</sub>ùö∫ floor(20 / 5<sup>k</sup>)
  * floor(20/5<sup>1</sup>)
  * 4
  * 5<sup>4</sup>
* 20! as 7: <sub>k>0</sub>ùö∫ floor(20 / 7<sup>k</sup>)
  * floor(20/7<sup>1</sup>)
  * 2
  * 7<sup>2</sup>  

#### 20! = 2<sup>18</sup> * 3<sup>8</sup> * 5<sup>4</sup> * 7<sup>2</sup> * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19
```python
import math

2**18 * 3**8 * 5**4 * 7**2 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 == math.factorial(20)

## 1.2.6 Binomial Coefficients

<summary>How many bridge hands are possible</summary>

This is calculated using the formulae n! / (k! * (n-k)!)

We can take each factorial expression n, k and n-k and calculate it as a product of prime factors.  
Once that has been done each exponential expression can either be multiplied or divided out.   
The final result can be seen [here](/exercises/chapter_1/two/binomial_coefficients.py)
```python
{2: 4, 5: 2, 7: 2, 17: 1, 23: 1, 41: 1, 43: 1, 47: 1}
```
2<sup>4</sup> * 5<sup>2</sup> * 7<sup>2</sup> * 17 * 23 * 41 * 43 * 47

## 1.2.8 Fibonacci Numbers
<details>
<summary>Counters Game - best move when n=1000</summary>

Rules - for 2 players
* There is a pile containing n counters. 
* The first player removes any number of counters, leaving at least one.  
* Each player must take at least one counter.
* Each player can take a maximum of 2 times the counters that the previous player took.

Let us imagine that there are 11 counters to start with.  

We shall assume that neither player wants to face certain loss.  
Therefore, their options shall be restricted to < CEIL(n/3)  

A summary of such a game make look like this:  

RC = Remaining Counters

| Turn | Player A | Options | RC  | Player B | Options | RC  |
|------|----------|---------|-----|----------|---------|-----|
| 0    | -        |         |     | -        |         | 11  |
| 1    | 3        | 1 2 3   | 8   | 1        | 1 2     | 7   |
| 2    | 2        | 1 2     | 5   | 1        | -       | 4   |
| 3    | 1        | -       | 3   | 1        | -       | 2   |
| 4    | 2        | -       | 0   |          |         |     |

This worked out pretty well for Player A. Only in their first turn did player B have any choice!  

Player B could have selected 2 counters.   
However, that would have left player A able to take a single counter from the 6 remaining, still leaving 5 counters for player B - ensuring victory!  

What if there are 15 counters? How many counters should Player A take?  
What are the max counters? max = CEIL(n/3) - 1 = 4.  
* This makes sense because if Player A took 5 counters player B would simply take 10 thus winning the game.  
* If Player A took 4 counters this would leave 11, which as we can see from our previous table allows player B certain victory.  
* What if Player A tries to always leave a fibonacci number of counters for his opponent?  
* At no time must he leave his opponent in a position to leave a fibonacci number of counters for him.  
* Options for Player A will be restricted with these rules in mind  

| Turn | Player A | Options | RC  | Player B | Options | RC  |
|------|----------|---------|-----|----------|---------|-----|
| 0    | -        |         |     | -        |         | 15  |
| 1    | 2        | -       | 13  | 4        | 1 2 3 4 | 9   |
| 2    | 1        | -       | 8   | 1        | 1 2     | 7   |
| 3    | 2        | -       | 5   | 1        | -       | 4   |
| 4    | 1        | -       | 3   | 1        | -       | 2   |
| 5    | 2        | -       | 0   |          |         |     |

Player A wins again! We note on turn 2 Player B could have chosen 2 counters.  
Player A Would then have taken 1 counter on turn 3 leaving the game in the same state.  
What about turn 1? Player B could have chosen 1, 2 or 3 instead. 
* Player B chooses 3, RC=10, Player A chooses 2. No difference.
* Player B chooses 2, RC=11, Player A chooses 3. No difference.
* Player B chooses 1, RC=12
  * Player A much choose 1. 
  * Choosing 2 would allow his opponent to leave him with a fibonacci number of counters.
  * RC=11. Now Player B can choose 1 or 2.  
  * If Player B leaves 10 counters Player A will choose 2 and leave 8.  
  * If Player B leaves 9 counters Player A will choose 1 and leave 8.
  * Either way certain victory follows for Player A.

What if there are 1000 counters. What move should Player A make?  
* max = CEIL(n/3) - 1
* n/3 = 333.33333...
* CEIL(333.333) = 334
* max = 333  

The most counters' player A can take is 333.  
* Player A must leave at least 1000 - 333 counters = 667
* The first Fibonacci number after 667 is 987.
* Player A must take **13 counters** for his first move

## 1.3.1 MIX 
<details>
<summary>Some functions explained</summary>

Some of the more complex functions are explained here in detail
<details>
<summary>CHAR</summary>

* Contents of rA is turned into a 10 byte code. 
  * Take our example of register A storing the number 10000.
  * 0 has a character code of 30
  * 1 has a character code of 31
  * rA would store 0's
    * This would equal 30 30 30 30 30
  * rX would store the string representation of 10000
    * This would equal 31 30 30 30 30
</details>

<details>
<summary>MOVE</summary>

* MOVE -1,1(1)
* MOVE x,y(z)
* x is the source memory address. The contents are copied to the memory address held in rI1
  * This is hard set to rI1 and is not changed by any of the variables x, y, z
* y is the index register and therefore must be between 1 and 6. 
  * The contents of the Index register are added to the source memory address
  * In our example y=1 which means the contents or rI1 are added to the initial memory location of -1
  * As rI1 held the address of 2 the source memory address is modified to memory location 1.
  * Therefore, the contents of 1 (0/NOP) is copied to 2
  * rI1 is then incremented by 1
* z is the number of operations or copies that are carried out
</details>

<details>
<summary>NUM</summary>

* 1000010000 is assumed to be a number in string text. 
* We may see this in modern programming languages as "1000010000"
* Each Byte in MIX can contain 6 bits allowing a maximum of 64 values
  * This allows for 0 - 63 in binary 000000 to 111111
* Each word can store 6 bytes 
  * This allows for the +/- sign and 5 bytes
    * [+][0][0][0][0][63] would simply be 63
    * [+][0][0][0][1][0] would be 64 as we have used the next byte
    * [+][0][0][1][0][0] would be 64<sup>2</sup> or 3969
    * Therefore, each byte can allow a maximum of 64<sup>i</sup> values
    * [+][64<sup>4</sup>][64<sup>4</sup>][64<sup>3</sup>][64<sup>2</sup>][64<sup>1</sup>] represent the max values depending on position
* To turn manually "1000010000" into a numeric value that MIX can understand we have to find the log base 2 of this number
* log<sub>2</sub>1000010000 = ~29.897
  * 64 = 2<sup>6</sup> and so log<sub>64</sub>1000010000 = 29.897 / 6 = ~4.98
  * If this was over 5 we would not be able to store it
    * In this case MIX stores the remainder

<summary>Q2: Store 99 999 999</summary>

Each byte has a maximum value of 64.  
The max value that can be stored in each of the 5 cells is 63 * the following powers of 64: 64<sup>4</sup> 64<sup>3</sup> 64<sup>2</sup> 64<sup>1</sup> 64<sup>0</sup>  
log<sub>2</sub>99 999 999 = ~26.58  
* 64 = 2<sup>6</sup>
* 26.58 / 6 = 4.43
* Now we know we need 5 bytes to store this number
  * 99 999 999 / 64<sup>4</sup>(16777216) = ~5.96
  * The first byte is 5
  * Remainder = 99999999 - (5 * 64<sup>4</sup>) = 16 113 919
  * 16 113 919 / 64<sup>3</sup>(262144) = ~61.47
  * The second byte is 61
  * Remainder = 16113919 - (61 * 64<sup>3</sup>) = 123135
  * 123135 / 64<sup>2</sup>(4096) = ~30.06
  * The third byte is 30
  * Remainder = 123135 - 30 * 64<sup>2</sup> = 255
  * 255 / 64 = ~3.98
  * The fourth byte is 3
  * Remainder = 255 - (3*64) = 63
  * The firth byte is 63
* Therefore, 99 999 999 can be represented by +5 61 30 3 64

<summary>Q5: What does the instruction -80 3 5 4 represent?</summary>

* -80 is memory location -80
* 3 tells us to add the memory location (in this case of -80) to the value store in register I3
* 5 says to use all 5 fields or use a particular operation
* 4 is the operation code in this case DIV or FDIV. As DIV is 0:5 and the previous instruction was 5 the operation we need is DIV  

**The resulting translated operation will be DIV -80,3**

<summary>Q6: What is the result of the following "load" instructions</summary>

Memory 3000 contains +5 1 200 15  

Instructions:
* LDAN 3000 - load negative A - A is set to -5 1 200 15 
* LD2N 3000(3:4) - load negative rI2 - register I2 is set to -200
* LDX 3000(1:3) - value is stored in rX - the last fields of register X is set to 5 1 ?  
* LD6 3000 - value is stored in rI6 - register I6 is undefined - as we are trying to fit 5 cells into 2
* LDXN 3000(0:0) - load negative X - register X sign is set to negative

<summary>Q8: What are the results after the DIV 1000 instruction</summary>

rA before: -0  
rX before: -1234 0 3 1  
cell 1000: -000 2 0  
Instruction DIV 1000  
-1234031 / -20 we can negate the negative signs = 1234031 / 20 = 61701.55  
rA = +0 617 0 1  
Get remainder: 1234031 - (61701 * 20) = 1234031 - 1234020 = 31 - 20 = 11  
rX = -00011

<summary>Q12: Multiply rI3 by 2 and store in rI3</summary>

The question asks for this to be done in a single instruction.    
The command INC3 increases rI3 by a given amount.  
We also know that adding a comma to an instruction, using the "I" field, adds the contents of the "I" registers.  
Therefore, we can simply add the contents of rI3 back to itself with this command. This has the effect of mutliplying by 2.

<summary>Q13: Jump Conditions</summary>

JOV: If overflow is on, turn it off and jump  
JNOV: If overflow is off, jump. If it is on switch it off  

If location 1000 contains the instruction `JOV 1001` The overflow toggle will be set to off and the next instruction exectued will be 1001 as normal
What are the effects of changing this to `JNOV 1001`, `JOV 1000`, `JNOV 1000`  
* JNOV 1001: The overflow is turned off if set to on - the next instruction is 1001 anyway
* JOV 1000: If the overflow is on it is turned off. We then jump to 1000 where the overflow is now off and so the program resumes as normal
* JNOV 1000: If the overflow is off we jump back to 1000. This can cause an infinite loop

If the starting cell is 0 then there will be some discrepancies:
* The sign on rI1 will be - not +
* The overflow toggle will be set to off
* The comparison indicator will be set to EQUAL not LESS
  * This is because the ADD 1 instruction will add zero as the contents of memory 1 will be zero.

<summary>Sorting Algorithm</summary>

* This algorithm is able to find the greatest number and send it to the end 
* Once it has found the greatest number it then finds the next greatest number 
* A decreasing loop discounts items already sorted
* The following table shows the algorithm
* The table after shows the steps required to sort 3 numbers

## 2.2.2 Sequential Allocation
<details>
<summary>Q1: How many items can be in the queue at one time without OVERFLOW OCCURRING?</summary>

Answer: M - 1 not M

Insert algorithm
* if R == M, then R = 1 else R += 1
* if R == F, then OVERFLOW
* X[R] = Y

Delete algorithm
* if F == R, then UNDERFLOW;
* if F == M, then F = 1 else F += 1
* Y = X[F]

Scenario: F = R = 0

| Command | R == M? | Set R | R == F? | X[R] = Y | X[1] | x[2] | x[3] |
|---------|---------|-------|---------|----------|------|------|------|
| INS 5   | 0 != 3  | 1     | 1 != 0  | X[1] = 5 | 5    |      |      |
| INS 6   | 1 != 3  | 2     | 2 != 0  | x[2] = 6 | 5    | 6    |      |
| INS 7   | 2 != 3  | 3     | 3 != 0  | x[3] = 7 | 5    | 6    | 7    |
| INS 8   | 3 == 3  | 1     | 1 != 0  | x[1] = 8 | 8    | 6    | 7    |

As we see above no OVERFLOW occurred and now we have lost data!  
We cannot store M number of items because we cannot detect overflow.  

What if F = R = 1

| Command | R == M? | Set R | R == F? | X[R] = Y | X[1] | x[2] | x[3] |
|---------|---------|-------|---------|----------|------|------|------|
| INS 5   | 1 != 3  | 2     | 2 != 1  | X[2] = 5 |      | 5    |      |      
| INS 6   | 2 != 3  | 3     | 3 != 1  | x[3] = 6 |      | 5    | 6    |      
| INS 7   | 3 == 3  | 1     | 1 == 1  | OVERFLOW | 5    | 6    | 7    |

So we have given up a memory space but now we can see OVERFLOW gets triggered correctly.  

Therefore, with this algorithm we must set F = R = 1 and so we can only store M -1 items before OVERFLOW is triggered.

<summary>Q2: Give specifications for "delete from rear" and "insert at front"</summary>

### Delete from rear
First attempt
* If R = F; then UNDERFLOW
* Y <- X[R]
* R <- R - 1

However, according to the answer I have missed out a step. That is setting R to M when R is 1.  
At first I could not see why this is needed. After all if we take R = F = 1 then R cannot ever catch up to 1 surely?  
However sequential allocation is done circulatory - after all there is a limited amount of memory.  
This is not a straight rail track as it were it is more of a loop.  

Scenario: 
Initial values: M = 3, R = 1, F = 1  
Instructions: INS 5, INS 6m DEL, INS 7  
NUM[D] denotes a soft delete - it's safe to rewrite this location 

| CMD             | STEP 1 | STEP 2 | STEP 3 | R   | F   | X1   | X2   | X3  |
|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|-----|-----|------|------|-----|
| INS 5           | R != M | R = 2  | R != F | 2   | 1   |      | 5    |     |
| INS 6           | R != M | R = 3  | R != F | 3   | 1   |      | 5    | 6   |
| DEL             | F != R | F != M | F = 2  | 3   | 2   |      | 5[D] | 6   |
| INS 7           | R == M | R = 1  | R != F | 1   | 2   | 7    | 5[D] | 6   |  
| DEL (FROM REAR) | R != F | R = 0  |        | 0   | 2   | 7[D] | 5[D] | 6   |

As you can see from the table above we have set R to an invalid or unexpected memory location!  
Therefore we must include the step of setting R to M  

Complete answer  
* If R = F; then UNDERFLOW
* Y <- X[R]
* If R = 1; then R <- M OTHERWISE R <- R - 1

Now let us see that last line again

| CMD             | STEP 1 | STEP 2 | R   | F   | X1   | X2   | X3  |
|-----------------|--------|--------|-----|-----|------|------|-----|
| DEL (FROM REAR) | R != F | R = 1  | 3   | 2   | 7[D] | 5[D] | 6   |

### Insert at front

First attempt
* Given R = F = 1
* If F = 1 Then F <- M Else F = F - 1
* X[F] <- Y
* If F = R then OVERFLOW

However, the answer gives this in a different order

Let us see what is the issue with this first attempt  
We now have INS F, INS R, DEL F, DEL R commands  

Given M = 3

| CMD       | STEP 1 | STEP 2 | STEP 3   | R   | F   | X1  | X2  | X3  |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| INS F (5) | R != M | R = 2  | R != F   | 2   | 1   |     | 5   |     |
| INS R (6) | F = 1  | F = 3  | R != F   | 2   | 3   |     | 5   | 6   |
| INS R (7) | F != 1 | F = 2  | OVERFLOW | 2   | 2   |     | 7   |     |

So we can see that the OVERFLOW happened too late in this example.   
We have now overwritten X2 without the user expecting this behaviour.   
Data integrity has been compromised.  

What happens if we alter the algorithm so the assignment is after OVERFLOW?  
* Given R = F = 1
* If F = 1 Then F <- M Else F = F - 1
* If F = R then OVERFLOW Else X[F] <- Y

We can clearly see now that OVERFLOW would be triggered without a memory assignment.  

However, in Donald Knuths answer the assignment to memory is done first.  

* X[F] <- Y
* If F = 1 Then F <- M Else F = F - 1
* If F = R then OVERFLOW
What effect would this have on our previous example?

| CMD       | STEP 1 | STEP 2 | STEP 3   | R   | F   | X1  | X2  | X3  |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| INS F (5) | R != M | R = 2  | R != F   | 2   | 1   |     | 5   |     |
| INS R (6) | F = 1  | F = 3  | R != F   | 2   | 3   | 6   | 5   |     |
| INS R (7) | F != 1 | F = 2  | OVERFLOW | 2   | 2   | 6   | 5   | 7   |

Both methods appear functional. They both store 5 and 6 in memory and trigger OVERFLOW when a third item is added.

However, more complex scenarios would have to be engineered to understand the differences.

<summary>Q3: A Mix Extension - indirect addressing</summary>
The indirect addressing works by adding the result of the index register  
You will notice that this is an addition because we have an extra field at location 7  

Location 1000 = NOP 1000,1:7  
Location 1001 = NOP 1000,2  
Index register 1 = 1  
Index register 2 = 2  

Let us now work through the equivalent of the following instruction   
LDA 1000,7:2  

In location 1000 we have 1000,1:7 so let us replace 1000,7 with this instruction. The 7 indicates all fields are used.  
LDA (1000,1:7),2  
This is where we add the value of index 1, 1 to the value of 1000.  
LDA (1001,7),2  
We now take all the fields of 1001 (NOP 1000,2) and replace 1000,7 with this instuction
LDA (1000,2), 2  
Now we add the contents of i2 to the value of 1000  
LDA 1002, 2
Again we add the contents of i2 to the value of 1000  
LDA 1004

So this would come in handy when certain locations are unknown we can now store locations as variables and access them, indirectly.
